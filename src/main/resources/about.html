<h1>Codewars plugin</h1>
<p>
    This is not an official codewars.com plugin.
    This is an open source project created by a fellow warrior.
    The source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ansis-m/CodeWarsPlugin">https://github.com/ansis-m/CodeWarsPlugin</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I am still working on the project and the plugin is quite buggy.
    Please report bugs and send suggestions to <a href="maleckisansis@gmail.com">maleckisansis@gmail.com</a>.
    Also, consider contributing to the project on github.
    The codebase is very raw and there is a lot of room for improvement.
</p>
<p>
    The plugin currently supports katas in:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Java</strong> in Intellij community and ultimate</li>
        <li><strong>Kotlin</strong> in Intellij community and ultimate</li>
        <li><strong>Groovy</strong> in Intellij community and ultimate</li>
        <li><strong>Python</strong> in PyCharm, Intellij community and ultimate</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Typescript</strong> in Intellij ultimate and WebStorm</li>
        <li><strong>Ruby</strong> in Intellij ultimate and RubyMine</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    To start a kata in any of the supported languages you first need to create a project (or at least a module) for that specific language.
    Next, sign-in to codewars.com in the embedded browser. Chose a kata, select language and press "train".
    Navigation to the training page triggers creation of the kata files which will be opened in your Intellij workspace.
    Each kata will have a separate directory that will contain also a test file (for local testing) and some metafiles for the normal functioning of the plugin.

    Edit the work/test file and once you are done submit the local file for testing via "test" or "attempt" buttons.
    When you pass the "attempt" you will be able to submit the solution.
</p>

<p>
    You can start several/many katas in the same project/module.
    If the current project contains several katas, you can jump between them by using the drop-down menu on the bottom.
    The completed katas will have a green checkmark. You can also delete all the kata files.
</p>

   Happy coding!
